# AEM + Next JS integration for in-context editing
## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
```

## Integrating this code with AEM:

 - Copy all the content from here to `ui.frontend` folder 
 - Run `mnv clean install`

 This should automatically build the ui code and inject all the assets into client libs.
